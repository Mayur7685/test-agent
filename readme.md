# Prep-for-a-meeting AI agent
Crew of agents that will help us prepare for a meeting.

## User input 
- The names of the participants who are going to be in the meeting.
- The context of the meeting.
- The overall goal of the meeting.

## Expected output
Should be able to give us a detailed brrief for the meeting. This brief should contain relevant information about the industry, the people involved in the meeting, and relevant talking points that will help us get to our the goal we sent as input. 

In order to set up this crew, we should consider the following concepts: agents, tools, tasks and processes.

1. Tasks: These are the tasks that our agents will perform. Each task will be assigned to an agent.
2. Agents: These are the AI agents that will be working for us. Each agent is an expert in a different task. In this case, we will have 4 agents.
3. Tools: These are the tools that our agents will use to perform their tasks. These can be, for example, a search engine, a summarizer, a translator, etc.
4. Process: A process dictates the way that our agents will work together. In this case, we will use a sequential process, which means that each agent will work one after the other.
